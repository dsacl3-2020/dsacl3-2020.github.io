## Grading

Your grade will be determined based on
5 graded programming assignments (60%)
and a written exam (40%) at the end of the course.
The grade scale below will be used to convert the weighted scores to a final letter grade.

| Percent  |    Local      |  ECTS |
|----------|--------------:|:-----:|
| >96      | 1.0           |   A   |

| 89–92    | 1.7           |   B   |
| 85–88    | 2.0           |   B   |
| 81–84    | 2.3           |   C   |
| 77–80    | 2.7           |   C   |
| 73–76    | 3.0           |   C   |
| 69–72    | 3.3           |   D   |
| 65–68    | 3.7           |   E   |
| 60–64    | 4.0           |   E   |
| <60      | 5.0           |   F   |

Besides the graded assignments,
the course includes introductory assignments.
Although these are not graded,
they are a core part of the class,
and they should not be considered optional.

## Attendance

The course will start with online (synchronous) class sessions.
Attendance will not not be enforced.
However, it is **unlikely** that you will pass the course without regular attendance.
<!--
Presence sheets will be circulated during the course for
informational purposes only.
If you attend the class,
you are **required** to sign attendance sheets due to COVID-19 regulations.
-->


## Assignments

The following basic rules apply the assignments:

1. Assignments that are not handed in timely are graded *0/100*. If you are
   ill, present a note from the doctor **before** the deadline.
2. If your code does not run due to errors in your code, your
   assignment gets the grade *0/100*.
3. Code is graded for correctness and style.

You are strongly encouraged to work in pairs.
However, you are allowed to work with the same person only once
during the semester.
For those who have difficulty finding assignment partners
we will set up a random mach making system.
The parings from this system are only suggestions.
You may decide not to pair with the suggested person.
However, once you commit, you should be working *together*.

The code that you submit, **must** be your own code.
Cases of plagiarism will be reported to the faculty.
You are welcome to:

- Discuss a general approach to the solution of an assignment with your
  classmates.
- Get help debugging your code, but only AFTER you have really tried it
  yourself.

Things you are **not allowed** to do:

- Use someone else's code (in whole or in part), this includes code fragments
  from web sites such as Stack Overflow.
- Give your solution of an assignment (in whole or in part) to a classmate.
- Get so much help on an assignment that you can no longer honestly call it
  your own.

### Submissions

In this class we will make heavy use of [GitHub](https://gihub.com/)
and [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
Make sure to obtain a (free) GitHub account,
and familiarize yourself with the system
before you start working on your first assignment.

Assignments are only accepted through the GitHub repositories.
No other forms of submissions (e.g., via email) are accepted.

The following information should be provided as the file/module
[docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
in Python assignments, and as comments at the beginning of the file
for other file types that allow comments.

## Exams

The following basic rules apply for the exams:

* If you are too ill to take an exam, you must inform instructors by e-mail,
  **at least 60 minutes** before the beginning of the exam. You also need to
  present an attest from your doctor before enrolling into the re-examination.
* A re-examination of the final exam is possible, if and only if you
  failed the course, but it is still possible to get a passing overall
  grade by obtaining a higher grade on the exam.
