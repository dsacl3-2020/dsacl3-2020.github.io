## Introduction

This is the web page of the course
*Data Structures and Algorithms for Computational Linguistics III, WS 2020-2021*
taught at the
[Department of Computational Linguistics](http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/ascl.html),
[University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/).


This programming course provides an introduction to algorithms and data
structures that are commonly used in computational linguistics, such as
string distance measures, data structures for approximate string search,
and finite state automata and related algorithms. The course is driven by
assignments where participants implement these algorithms and data
structures in small, but practical, applications.

### Practical information

Please note that although we have a room reserved,
due to COVID-19 prevention regulations,
the course will start with online (synchronous) sessions.

| **Tutors**        | Anna-Katharina Dick [\<anna-katharina.dick@student.uni-tuebingen.de\>](mailto:anna-katharina.dick@student.uni-tuebingen.de)<br>Lea Grüner [\<lea.gruener@student.uni-tuebingen.de\>](lea.gruener@student.uni-tuebingen.de) |


### Goals

By the end of the course you will be able to:

  * Become (more) familiar with important data structures and
    algorithms, such as trees, priority queues, searching and sorting
  * Analyze algorithms for proving their correctness and complexity
  * Write programs for common string processing tasks, such as pattern matching
  * Write programs to query directed and undirected graphs, such as:
    - Are two vertices connected?
    - What is the shortest path between two vertices?
    - Does a directed graph contain cycles?
  * Implement a spell-checker
  * Implement a recognizer for finite state grammars

### GitHub registration

To register, and access to some of the course material, you need to complete
